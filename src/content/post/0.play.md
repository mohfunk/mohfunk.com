A google search for *"Play"* yields the following top result:

> **Play** *Noun.*\n
> An Activity engaged in for enjoyment and recreation, especially by children*.

which is equavlent in absurdity to defining *Sex* as "Activity engaged in for orgasm and euphoria, especially by adults."
<br>
**Play** is *instinctual* in essences, and should not be defined or thought of as above.
<br>
### *Note* that's all, the rest of the post is extra.
<br>
<br>
 As the sole extant species of the genus *Homo*, we're disposed to pompous surmises of human divinity.
 Our newly acquired primacy does not add features or alter the very essence of our instincts; we merely exhibit behavioural modernity. As we cultureized the consumption of nutrient in rich Cuisines, we cultureized *Play*.
<br>
<br>
All mammals play; in fact, Play is older than culture for culture presupposes human society.
> Animals of all kinds did not wait for man to teach them their playing.*
The *Instrinctual* essence of Play is irrefutable due to its integrality within animal life. *Play* is not deried fom a purely biological or a physical need; it is not a physiological phenomenon or a psychological reflex, even in its purest of forms.

## False Hypotheses of Play
Many psychologists and scientists hypothesized biological functions for Play; some of which include the following: 
- *Play* is a result of a need for *relaxation.*
- *Play* is a discharge of abundant vital energy.
- *Play* is a method by which young animals learn essential survival skills.
- *Play* is a *wish-fulfillment* activity.
- *Play* is an activity that satisfies the natural need for dominance and competition in a non-harmful environment.
All of these hypotheses share a glaring flaw: the inadequacy to encompass all instances of *Play,* according to Huizinga,
- we should drop the assumption that *Play* must serve a biological function.
- *Play* cannot be considered without its profoundly aesthetic properties.
- *Play* must not be thought of as a rational activity.

## What play is not
It’s challenging to define or explain *Play*, but it’s not difficult to differentiate it from what it’s not:
- the opposite of seriousness
- for children,
- rudimentary,
- senseless,
- artificial,
- pretentious,
- or man-made.
