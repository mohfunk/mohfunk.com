A powerful language must provide the following 3 mechanisms to allow the formulation of complex ideas from simpler ones:

* \- Primative Expressions
* \- Means of Combinations
* \- Means of Abstractions


## Functional Programming

Functional programming is based on the following basic ideas:

* \- Evaluation of Expression.
* \- Binding Variables to Values.

The purpose of an Expression is to produce a Value, multiple related Expressions are grouped in a function. A Mathematical function is a process (or mapping) that associates elements of one set to another, such that each element in the domain is associated with exactly one element in the range.

**The order of evaluations does not matter.**


## Imperative Programming

Imperative programming is based on the following ideas:

* \- Execution of Statements.
* \- Store of States

The purpose of a Statement is to alter the State of a variable in the Store of a program. A Statement may depends on the previous State of a Variable in order to alter it.

**The order of execution does matter.**
