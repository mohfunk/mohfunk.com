      - "I have always been frustrated with how Play is naively defined; for
        instance, a google search yields the following top result:"
      - "> **Play:**  *Noun.* Activity engaged in for enjoyment and recreation,
        especially by children*."
      - <br>
      - Animals of all kinds seem to engage in Play; even Dinosaurs, the deadly,
        cold-blooded reptiles, had a playful side! It is not merely an activity
        for enjoyment or recreation. Many of the ideas I discuss here are
        adopted from the Dutch thinker and historian [Johann
        Huizinga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Huizinga) I subscribe to
        his school of thought as an appreciator of Play, and as a student of its
        craft.
      - <br>

      - "As the sole extant species of the genus Homo, we're disposed to pompous
        surmises of human divinity. Without a doubt, Man is the dominant animal
        on the planet; however, our primacy is newly acquired. For millions of
        years, Man roamed the earth as a mammal of no significance; only
        withstanding the tremendous liablities of raising human infants
        metamorphosed hominins into the modern human being. It is without a
        doubt how we developed our most potent weapon: Language. Nevertheless,
        the sophistication of our societies and civilizations typifies the
        socialization instinct; the urge to procreate is manifested in social
        constructs, we further culturized the consumption of nutrient in our
        rich Cuisines. We do not add features or alter the very essence of our
        instincts; we merely exhibit behavioural modernity."
      - "## The Instinct of Play"
      - "We do not expound Sex as an activity that adults engage in for orgasm;
        though equally shallow, the facileness of defining Play as a
        recreational activity enjoyed by children is often neglected. All
        mammals play; in fact, Play is older than culture for culture
        presupposes human society. The historian Johan Huizinga has asserted
        that human civilization added no essential feature to the general idea
        of Play, animals of all kinds did not wait for man to teach them their
        playing. Dinosaurs inhabited the planet millions of years prior to
        hominids; yet still, evidence suggested they played. The instinctual
        essence of Play, although overlooked, is irrefutable due to its
        integrality within animal life. Play is not derived from a purely
        biological or a physical need; it is not a physiological phenomenon or a
        psychological reflex, even in its purest of forms. Many psychologists
        and scientists hypothesized biological functions for Play; some of which
        include the following: "
      - <br>
      - <br>
      - Play is
      - "- A result of a need for *relaxation.*"
      - "- A discharge of abundant vital energy."
      - "- A method by which young animals learn essential survival skills."
      - "- A *wish-fulfillment* activity."
      - "- An activity that satisfies the natural need for dominance and
        competition in a non-harmful environment."
      - "  "
      - <br>
      - All of these hypotheses share common flaws, the inadequacy to encompass
        all instances of Play stands glaring,Huizinga concluded that the
        assumption that Play must serve a biological function is a fallacious
        one; ergo theweakness of the hypotheses above. He further insisted that
        Play cannot be considered without its profoundly aestheticproperties,
        and must not be thought of as a rational activity. A theory that
        describes the function of Play mustrender all the previous hypotheses
        obsolete, or unify them as a coherent whole. It’s challenging to define
        or explainPlay, but it’s not difficult to differentiate it from what
        it’s not, Play is not the opposite of seriousness, it isnot for
        children, Play is not rudimentary, senseless, artificial, pretentious or
        man-made.
      - "## *H. Ludens*"
      - "The 18th century and its age of Enlightenment ignited Anti-clericalism
        and the worship of reason. The substantial advances of the 16th and 17th
        centuries in science and human thought blinded the many. We boldly, or
        perhaps naively, decided to name our species *Homo Sapiens*, Man the
        Rational. Thinkers refuted *Sapiens* as a name for our species,
        notwithstanding our ability to reason, irrationality is deeply rooted in
        human behaviour. We inclined to designate our species as *Homo Faber*,
        Man, the Maker; although, not as misleading as *Sapiens*, it is an
        unseemly name for a ruthless destroyer. Besides, the use of *H. Faber*:"
      - <br>
      - "> is a manifestation of man's innate being in nature, which represents
        the alienation from and objectification of nature."
      - <br>
      - as the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco argued. Johan Huizinga suggested
        *Homo Ludens,* Man, the Player. Linguistically, however, the Latin word
        *Luden* carries more meaning than merely Play.

      - "A powerful language must provide the following 3 mechanisms to allow
        the formulation of complex ideas from simpler ones:"
      - "* \\- Primative Expressions"
      - "* \\- Means of Combinations"
      - "* \\- Means of Abstractions"
      - "## Functional Programming"
      - "Functional programming is based on the following basic ideas:"
      - "* \\- Evaluation of Expression."
      - "* \\- Binding Variables to Values."
      - The purpose of an Expression is to produce a Value, multiple related
        Expressions are grouped in a function. A Mathematical function is a
        process (or mapping) that associates elements of one set to another,
        such that each element in the domain is associated with exactly one
        element in the range.
      - "**The order of evaluations does not matter.**"
      - "## Imperative Programming"
      - "Imperative programming is based on the following ideas:"
      - "* \\- Execution of Statements."
      - "* \\- Store of States"
      - The purpose of a Statement is to alter the State of a variable in the
        Store of a program. A Statement may depends on the previous State of a
        Variable in order to alter it.
