      - 'A google search for *"Play"* yields the following top result:'
      - "> **Play** *Noun.*\\n"
      - "> An Activity engaged in for enjoyment and recreation, especially by
        children*."
      - which is equavlent in absurdity to defining *Sex* as "Activity engaged
        in for orgasm and euphoria, especially by adults."
      - <br>
      - "**Play** is *instinctual* in essences, and should not be defined or
        thought of as above."
      - <br>
      - "### *Note* that's all, the rest of the post is extra."
      - <br>
      - <br>
      - " As the sole extant species of the genus *Homo*, we're disposed to
        pompous surmises of human divinity."
      - " Our newly acquired primacy does not add features or alter the very
        essence of our instincts; we merely exhibit behavioural modernity. As we
        cultureized the consumption of nutrient in rich Cuisines, we cultureized
        *Play*."
      - <br>
      - <br>
      - All mammals play; in fact, Play is older than culture for culture
        presupposes human society.
      - "> Animals of all kinds did not wait for man to teach them their
        playing.*"
      - The *Instrinctual* essence of Play is irrefutable due to its integrality
        within animal life. *Play* is not deried fom a purely biological or a
        physical need; it is not a physiological phenomenon or a psychological
        reflex, even in its purest of forms.
      - "## False Hypotheses of Play"
      - "Many psychologists and scientists hypothesized biological functions for
        Play; some of which include the following: "
      - "- *Play* is a result of a need for *relaxation.*"
      - "- *Play* is a discharge of abundant vital energy."
      - "- *Play* is a method by which young animals learn essential survival
        skills."
      - "- *Play* is a *wish-fulfillment* activity."
      - "- *Play* is an activity that satisfies the natural need for dominance
        and competition in a non-harmful environment."
      - "All of these hypotheses share a glaring flaw: the inadequacy to
        encompass all instances of *Play,* according to Huizinga,"
      - "- we should drop the assumption that *Play* must serve a biological
        function."
      - "- *Play* cannot be considered without its profoundly aesthetic
        properties."
      - "- *Play* must not be thought of as a rational activity."
      - "## What play is not"
      - "It’s challenging to define or explain *Play*, but it’s not difficult to
        differentiate it from what it’s not:"
      - "- the opposite of seriousness"
      - "- for children,"
      - "- rudimentary,"
      - "- senseless,"
      - "- artificial,"
      - "- pretentious,"
      - "- or man-made."

      - "A powerful language must provide the following 3 mechanisms to allow
        the formulation of complex ideas from simpler ones:"
      - "* \\- Primative Expressions"
      - "* \\- Means of Combinations"
      - "* \\- Means of Abstractions"
      - "## Functional Programming"
      - "Functional programming is based on the following basic ideas:"
      - "* \\- Evaluation of Expression."
      - "* \\- Binding Variables to Values."
      - The purpose of an Expression is to produce a Value, multiple related
        Expressions are grouped in a function. A Mathematical function is a
        process (or mapping) that associates elements of one set to another,
        such that each element in the domain is associated with exactly one
        element in the range.
      - "**The order of evaluations does not matter.**"
      - "## Imperative Programming"
      - "Imperative programming is based on the following ideas:"
      - "* \\- Execution of Statements."
      - "* \\- Store of States"
      - The purpose of a Statement is to alter the State of a variable in the
        Store of a program. A Statement may depends on the previous State of a
        Variable in order to alter it.
      - "**The order of execution does matter.**"
